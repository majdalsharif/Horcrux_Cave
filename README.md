### Project Story
You are a muggle who haven't used the command-line before. By exploring your surroundings and acquiring magic skills, you are destined to defeat Voldemort by finding the hidden Horcrux. You will learn new commands by using a terminal emulator based on a web browser. I named it "Horcrux Cave" inspired by Voldemort's immortality, where he split his soul into 8 parts in the past to be hidden inside many Horcruxes. We think that Voldemort knows his way around Stegnography and he used his magic spells to hide part of his soul inside an image. We are expected to learn how he does that, what's Stegnography, and how to reveal the hidden Horcrux and defeat him for good. Inside the terminal environment, you will find different files. One of these files contains the image with the hidden Horcrux. Can you try to find it?
