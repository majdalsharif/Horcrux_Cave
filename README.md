This is a terminal emulator for Harry Potter lovers. I named it "Horcrux Cave" inspired by Voldemort's immortality, where he split his soul into 8 parts in the past to be hidden inside many Horcruxes. In this challenge, one of these Horcruxes is an image file and this image contains part of his soul hidden inside, can you try to find it?

### Language Used
```
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery for DOM manipulation
```

### Project Story
I like understanding things, and I like making things more. Since the terminal deals with the file system, I decided to learn how to create one. I also thought that this project is going to be a great idea for beginners who knows too little about the command-line system and how to navigate the file-system through the terminal. That's why I decided to make it an educational challenge more than a game.
